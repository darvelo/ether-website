<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Ether has three major classes that have been designed to have very similar APIs, which makes Ether easier to learn and code using Ether easier to read. Each section of this documentation shows the methods and properties specific to each class, while the Shared Methods and Properties section shows which they have in common.</p>

<p>Ether has no dependencies except for the assumption that a global Promise constructor is available in your environment.</p>
